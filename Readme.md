Project Title: Multi-Source Data Hub

Description: We are creating a dashboard to incorporate data from different sources to help users get it at the same place. Users will be able to see the weather, air quality, live traffic data and other information at the same place. We are also trying to add a community based incident reporting system for different important things such electricity cut-off, internet outage etc.

Tech Stack: JavaScript (Python maybe used too)

Features: 
Ability to view data about the city in different categories at the same place. 
Ability to report incidents and view incidents reported by other users.

Originality: We're somewhat inspired from DownDetector. However, the project is different in a lot of ways.
